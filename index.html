      <h2>Work Experience</h2>
      <p>As a passionate graphic designer with a strong eye for detail and creativity, I specialize in creating visually compelling designs that communicate ideas and enhance user experiences. My expertise includes Adobe Creative Suite (Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign), branding, typography, and digital illustrations.

        Currently, I am expanding my skill set by learning front-end development, focusing on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like Next.js. I aim to bridge the gap between design and development by crafting visually stunning and functional web experiences.
        
        I am always eager to collaborate on projects that combine both design and code to bring creative ideas to life!</p>
